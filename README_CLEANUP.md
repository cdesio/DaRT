# DaRT standalone (clean)

This directory contains one selected copy of each core component:
- photon_simulation
- simulation
- testSet
- geometryFiles
- Clustering

Selection reference: `RBE-main-2`.

Why this selection:
- `RBE-main-2` is the most complete and internally consistent version of all five components.
- Other copies (`RBE`, `RBE_pebble`, `RBE_laura`, `laura/rbe`) contain older code paths, local experiment edits, and/or build/output artifacts.
